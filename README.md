# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a Decision Tree Classifier. It involves data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files:

1. **Online_Payment_Fraud_Detection.ipynb**  
   - A Jupyter notebook that contains all steps from data loading to fraud detection.
   - Key steps include:
     - **Data Exploration**: Visualize and analyze transaction types.
     - **Feature Engineering**: Map categorical values to numerical, prepare features for the model.
     - **Correlation Analysis**: Understand relationships between variables.
     - **Modeling**: Train a Decision Tree Classifier on transaction data.
     - **Prediction**: Predict fraud based on transaction features.

2. **download_dataset.pdf**  
   - A PDF file containing the Google Drive link to download the `credit_card.csv` dataset required for the project.

## Dataset

The dataset contains transactions labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate. Download it from the link provided in the **download_dataset.pdf** file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
   ```

3. Download the dataset from the link in **download_dataset.pdf**.
4. Open the Jupyter notebook and follow the instructions.

## Key Libraries

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Plotly**: For interactive pie chart visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model training.

## How to Use

1. Download the dataset.
2. Open **Online_Payment_Fraud_Detection.ipynb** in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook step by step to explore the data, train the model, and make predictions.
